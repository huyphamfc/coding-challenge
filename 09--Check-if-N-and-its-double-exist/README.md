# Check If N and Its Double Exist

Given an array `array` of integer, check if there exists two integers `M` and `N` such that `M` is the double of `N` (i.e. `M = 2*N`).

Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: M = 10 is the double of N = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [7,1,14,11]
Output: true
Explanation: M = 14 is the double of N = 7,that is, 14 = 2 * 7.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: In this case does not exist M and N, such that M = 2 * N.
```
