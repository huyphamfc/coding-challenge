# Third Maximum Number

Given an integer array `arr`, return the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number.

Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```
