# Move Zeroes

Given an integer array, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: array = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: array = [0]
Output: [0]
```
