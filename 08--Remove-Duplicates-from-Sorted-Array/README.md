# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `array` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Do **NOT** allocate extra space for another array. Must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

```
Input: array = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, array = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of array being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: array = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, array = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of array being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k.
```
